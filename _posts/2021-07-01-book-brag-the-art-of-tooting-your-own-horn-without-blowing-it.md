It is well documented that working hard isn't enough to keep your professional star rising: Self-promotion is recognized as one of the most important attributes for getting ahead. But learning to share your talents and successes without coming across as smug or rehearsed is a tricky skill. Now, Peggy Klaus, top communication and leadership coach, has developed a program that will teach anyone to brag - and get away with it. Filled with practical examples of ways in which people in various work-life stages can promote themselves, Klaus teaches readers to communicate strengths and accomplishments without appearing too opportunistic, eager, egotistical, or self-aggrandizing. Now, anyone can communicate with style and substance - in any situation - and walk away shining like the star they are.
