When crafting prompts for instructional design, something that could exceed the model's limits, you can use a format similar to:

1. **Topic:** Specify the topic or subject you want to teach.

2. **Learning Objectives:** Clearly define the specific objectives or goals you want to achieve through your teaching.

3. **Structure/Outline:** Outline the overall structure of your teaching material, including sections, subtopics, or modules.

4. **Key Concepts:** Identify and list the key concepts or ideas that need to be covered in the teaching material.

5. **Explanations/Examples:** Provide concise explanations and examples for each key concept to help illustrate and clarify the subject matter.

6. **Visual Aids/Resources:** If applicable, mention any visual aids, diagrams, or additional resources that would support the teaching material.

7. **Exercises/Practice:** Include any exercises, practice questions, or activities that can be used to reinforce learning.

8. **References/Bibliography:** If there are specific external sources or references that you want to include, list them here.

By using this format, you can maintain an organized structure and keep track of the important elements of your teaching material. The key is to be concise yet comprehensive, focusing on the essential information while providing clarity.

***Remember*** to maintain any external resources, such as references, diagrams, or supplementary materials, in a separate document or file outside of our conversation. This way, you can refer to them as needed and provide necessary context when seeking assistance within our conversation.
