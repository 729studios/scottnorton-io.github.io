**The Genesis - A Network in Peril:**

When CW&L first began operations, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) were given little consideration. The company's focus was predominantly on business growth and customer acquisition. Unfortunately, this lack of a structured GRC program allowed for severe lapses in their security and compliance measures. Their flat, unsegmented network made it easy for data to flow unchecked, and cardholder data was stored unencrypted, presenting a ripe target for cybercriminals. 

The inevitable happened in 2018, when CW&L suffered a major data breach. This catastrophic event was a wake-up call and signaled the urgent need for a comprehensive GRC program.

**The Turning Point - Recognizing the Need for a Robust GRC Program:**

In the aftermath of the breach, the company hired a new CISO, who brought a fresh perspective and recognized the importance of a strong GRC program. The first order of business was a complete overhaul of the company's network, segmenting it into a CDE network, an administrative network supporting the CDE, a corporate network, and a guest wireless network. They also adopted a data flow design that accounted for all processes where cardholder data was encountered, from payment channels and refunds to fraud detection and billing.

**Establishing Foundational GRC Processes:**

Next, CW&L began to develop formalized policies and procedures around various critical areas:

1. Vulnerability Management: Initially reactive, CW&L shifted to a proactive approach. Regular vulnerability scans, patch management processes, and penetration testing became the norm, with security awareness training to ensure that every employee became part of the vulnerability management process.

2. Log Monitoring: From a state of basic logging, CW&L established a centralized log management system with automated log monitoring tools to analyze logs in real-time. The introduction of regular reviews and integration of threat intelligence feeds further enhanced their log monitoring capabilities.

3. Access Control: The company moved from an open-access system to a stringent, role-based access control (RBAC) mechanism that embraced the 'principle of least privilege'. Introduction of multi-factor authentication and robust authorization measures added more layers of security.

4. Security Policies: CW&L formulated comprehensive security policies covering various areas, such as access control, data protection, and incident response, among others. The policies were disseminated through company-wide training sessions to foster a security-conscious culture.

**The DESV Challenge and Maturing of the GRC Program:**

After the 2018 breach, CW&L was designated a high-risk merchant and had to navigate the rigorous requirements of DESV. The company rose to the challenge, ramping up their continuous monitoring and detection capabilities, implementing additional security controls, and defining clear management responsibilities for data protection. The successful navigation of the DESV process marked a significant milestone in the evolution of CW&L's GRC program.

**Present Day - A Robust and Dynamic GRC Program:**

Today, CW&L's GRC program stands as a testament to their commitment to security and compliance. The company continues to conduct regular audits of their security controls, and their QSA performs yearly re-validation of their DESV compliance. The company's GRC program has also helped them achieve and maintain compliance with PCI DSS v4.0.

The journey from zero to hero was a challenging but valuable exercise for CW&L. It transformed them from a company with severe security lapses to an organization with a robust GRC program, setting a strong example for others in the payment card industry.
