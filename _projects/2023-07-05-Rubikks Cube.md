🌴 You might have systems that decided to take an unannounced sabbatical and stopped logging months ago.

🚀 Or systems that missed their flight to the 'Security Update Land' within the mandatory 30-day period.

💽 Imagine a team sprinkling a spreadsheet with credit card numbers like it's confetti, and storing it on SharePoint for good measure.

🔐 And don't even get me started on the team that swept sensitive servers into production, conveniently forgetting to change those 'password123' default credentials.

Feels like a saga of cosmic proportions, doesn't it?

Good news is, it doesn't have to be this way. Aligning with a trusted advisor or QSA can help transform your PCI Compliance journey from an interstellar odyssey to a walk in the park.

Remember, in the realm of PCI Compliance, every step counts, no matter how small. So let's take that first step together.
