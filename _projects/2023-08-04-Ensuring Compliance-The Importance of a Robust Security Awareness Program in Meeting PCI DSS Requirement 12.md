**Article:**

The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an essential tool in the fight against data breaches and payment card fraud. One of its key components, Requirement 12, mandates that entities must maintain an Information Security Policy, and under this falls the critical sub-requirement 12.6: the establishment and execution of an ongoing security awareness program. 

In the new PCI DSS v4.0, Requirement 12.6 has been thoroughly outlined to further underscore its importance in protecting cardholder data. Under 12.6, entities are required to build a formal security awareness program aimed at educating all personnel on information security policies, procedures, and their role in protecting cardholder data.

The program needs to be comprehensive and updated as necessary to address evolving threats and vulnerabilities. It should ensure that personnel are not only aware of potential risks, but also well-equipped to respond to them. This includes becoming knowledgeable about the threat landscape and the operation of relevant security controls. 

For new hires, and at least once a year for all personnel, security awareness training must be provided. This training should leverage multiple methods of communication and needs to cover critical areas such as threats, vulnerabilities, phishing, social engineering, and acceptable use of end-user technologies.

So, what kind of documentation and evidence will your assessing Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) be asking for during the annual assessment?

1. **Your Security Awareness Program:** Your QSA will want to see a well-documented program that covers all the points detailed under Requirement 12.6. This should include the entityâ€™s information security policies, procedures, and the role of personnel in protecting cardholder data.

2. **Training Records:** Evidence that training has been provided to all personnel upon hire and at least annually thereafter.

3. **Acknowledgment Receipts:** QSAs will need to see evidence that personnel have read, understood, and acknowledged your security policies and procedures.

4. **Review and Update Records:** Demonstrate that your program is reviewed at least annually and updated as needed to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

5. **Specific Training Materials:** Materials that address phishing, social engineering, and the acceptable use of end-user technologies.

In conclusion, the emphasis on creating a robust and continually evolving security awareness program under Requirement 12.6 is a testament to the importance PCI DSS places on the role of personnel in protecting cardholder data. By ensuring your program is comprehensive, up-to-date, and effectively communicated to all personnel, you will be well on your way to not only achieving compliance with PCI DSS but also creating a safer, more secure environment for handling cardholder data.

**SEO Article Summary:** Learn about PCI DSS Requirement 12.6 and the importance of having a robust security awareness program. Discover what documentation and evidence QSAs will request during your annual assessment.

**TL;DR:** PCI DSS Requirement 12.6 mandates the establishment of a comprehensive, updated security awareness program to educate personnel on information security policies and procedures. Entities must be ready to provide documentation of the program, training and acknowledgment records, and evidence of program reviews and updates.
