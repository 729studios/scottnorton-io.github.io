**The Trigger - PCI DSS Compliance Failure:**

Following the significant data breach in 2018, CW&L was reclassified as a high-risk merchant by the payment brands, based on the number of transactions they processed and the severity of the breach. This new status meant that they were now subject to the Designated Entities Supplemental Validation (DESV). DESV is a set of additional validation procedures on top of PCI DSS for entities deemed to have higher risk.

**Assessment Stage - Understanding DESV Requirements:**

Navigating the DESV was an immense task for CW&L. DESV has additional requirements focused on the security of critical systems and data, management responsibilities, and the effectiveness of security controls. The company began by thoroughly assessing these requirements and understanding the gaps between their current practices and what the DESV mandated.

**Enhancement Stage - Meeting the DESV Requirements:**

The journey to meet the DESV requirements involved several critical improvements. Key among these was a greater emphasis on continuous monitoring and detection capabilities. They increased the frequency of vulnerability assessments, implemented additional intrusion detection systems, and made log monitoring a round-the-clock operation. 

Another major change involved their security governance. The DESV required clear responsibilities and accountability for the protection of payment card data. To meet this requirement, CW&L defined explicit roles and responsibilities for all members of the organization, from the board of directors down to the operational level.

**Verification Stage - Proving Compliance:**

Once the enhancements were implemented, CW&L needed to validate their compliance with DESV. This required an on-site review by a qualified security assessor (QSA). The QSA closely examined CW&L's security controls, processes, and documentation to ensure they met all DESV requirements. 

**Ongoing Compliance - Maintaining DESV Compliance:**

After successfully validating their compliance with DESV, CW&L committed to maintaining this higher standard of security. They established regular internal audits and engaged their QSA for yearly re-validation. They also committed to continuously improving their security posture, ensuring they were always ready for the stringent DESV requirements.

**Current Status - Successful DESV Compliance:**

Today, CW&L proudly maintains their compliance with DESV, showcasing their dedication to secure payment card processing. The journey to DESV compliance was a challenging one but proved to be a valuable exercise in strengthening their security posture. The DESV process also contributed significantly to fostering a culture of security and responsibility throughout the organization.
