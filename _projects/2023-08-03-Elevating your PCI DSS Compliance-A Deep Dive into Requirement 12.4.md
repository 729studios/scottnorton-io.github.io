As an organization that handles cardholder data, PCI DSS compliance is a fundamental part of your operations. The updated PCI DSS v4.0 has enhanced certain requirements, aiming to further secure cardholder data. One such update is Requirement 12.4.

Requirement 12.4 of PCI DSS v4.0 emphasizes the need for executive management's active role in maintaining a PCI DSS compliance program. It also mandates regular reviews to ensure the program's effectiveness.

Here are the key aspects that your assessing QSA will be focusing on:

1. **Executive Management's Role (Requirement 12.4.1)**: As per this requirement, your organization's executive management must take charge of protecting cardholder data and maintaining PCI DSS compliance. They should define a charter for the compliance program and ensure its communication across the organization. Your QSA will be looking for documented evidence of this charter, outlining executive management's roles and responsibilities.

2. **Regular Reviews (Requirement 12.4.2)**: This requirement mandates that your organization conducts reviews every three months to confirm that personnel are following all security policies and operational procedures. These reviews must be performed by personnel who are not responsible for the task being reviewed, ensuring a fair and unbiased evaluation. Be prepared to present to your QSA the documentation of these reviews and the established procedures to carry them out.

3. **Review Documentation (Requirement 12.4.2.1)**: Every review you conduct under Requirement 12.4.2 needs to be documented, capturing the review results, remediation actions for non-compliant practices, and sign-offs from the personnel assigned responsibility for the compliance program. Your QSA will need to see these documented results and the process by which remediation actions are determined and implemented.

Ensuring your adherence to these requirements does not only make your annual assessment smoother, but also provides assurance that your organization's approach to cardholder data security is robust and effective. So, step up your PCI DSS compliance game by focusing on executive management's accountability and regular reviews. These two pillars will go a long way in creating a secure environment for your cardholder data.
